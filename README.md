## Hey, I'm Jethro. ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack web developer currently living and working in sunny South Africa. 

My go-to technologies include [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/), [AlpineJS](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) but I am also a firm believer in keeping it simple, utilizing regular HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript as much as possible. 

ðŸ”­&nbsp;In my free time Iâ€™m working on [jethromay.com](https://jethromay.com), adding new features and writing educational articles.

ðŸŒ±&nbsp;Iâ€™m currently learning [Go](https://golang.org/).

ðŸ“«&nbsp;For casual questions its best to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/may_jethro) otherwise you can email me at <hello@jethromay.com>.
